            <p>
                I'm new to coding, so I don't have any great big projects up in the running, nor in the wings, just yet
                but I do plan to make some more of these essencial assignments and perhaps make some new websites for
                fun! Below I've included some of the projects that I'll be chipping away at, as well as how you can find
                me on GitHub. I'm still figuring it all out, so it may be a bit crude, but you'll be able to see my growth
                as I work on honing and growing my skills this trimester.
            </p>

            <h2>Find Me on GitHub</h2>
            <p>
                You can find me on GitHub by the same name that I go by on this Website: MintAloe. There, you'll be able
                to see all the projects that I'm proud enough to publish or everything that I'm working on collaboratively
                with other people/classmates.
            </p>

            <h2>Project Overviews</h2>
                <h3>OctoLessons</h3>
                <p>The first project that I've done in this class was actually helping out on the dev team for an ambitious
                project that we wanted to make. While I'm not on the dev team anymore, I still encourage you to check it
                out, it's really encouring to see people who are fairly young work together to create something new!</p> 

                <h3>MintEssencials</h3>
                <p>This is acutally the website that you are on right now! In the future, I'll be making more essencial
                    assignments and work to improve my programming abilities and understanding of computer science
                    overall.
