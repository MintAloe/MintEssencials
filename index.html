                    <h1>Welcome</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to my website, my name is MintAloe and this website is made as an essential assignment, 
                    hence the name: MintEssencials. It's part of the new ICS (Introduction to Computer Science) course 
                    that I'm taking. In light of the coranvirus, essencial assignments are a way that our district is 
                    using to help assure that we get class credit despite not being able to go to class. Here you'll 
                    find some pages about possible careers in the field of computer science as well as projects that 
                    I'm hoping to work on. Please enjoy!</p>

                            <p>I lied. My name's not actually MintAloe, that does happen to be one of my favourite alliases at the 
                            moment though! I quite enjoy aliases and... if I'm being perfeclty honest: this allias situation of 
                            mine is getting totally out of control. I went a bit pseudonym crazy and now have more of them then 
                            I know what to do with... well... that's not exactly true. I have a few key names for different 
                            things I like to do: one for writing, one for programming, one for gaming on microsoft and steam, 
                            one for Origin and mobile games, and even another on the side for whatever else I like to use it for. 
                            Then there are the other ones that I may have totally forgotten what their purpose is! I'm just 
                            missing one for sewing, another for art, and maybe a third for design.... I feel like I probably 
                            should be stopped but it's far too much fun! With that... my email situation is a bit out of control 
                            too...</p>
